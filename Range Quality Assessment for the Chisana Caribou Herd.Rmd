# Intro

The Chisana Caribou Herd (CCH) is a small herd of woodland caribou located in northeastern Wrangell St. Elias (WRST) National Park and Preserve in Alaska and the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge in the Yukon. During the early 1990s, many caribou herds in interior Alaska experienced population declines of varying severity (Valkenburg et al., 1996). From 1989 to 2001, the CCH population dropped from an estimated 1800 to 400 individuals (R. Farnell, unpublished data). The CCH became listed as a “Specially Protected” population in 2002 under the Yukon’s Federal Species at Risk Act. After the implementation of a captive rearing program and the development of an international, multiagency management plan, the CCH population is now stable and open to subsistence hunting. However, the current population is significantly below pre-decline levels. Several factors most likely contributed to the CCH population decline including predation, low recruitment, and poor habitat.

Lichens may be the greatest feature limiting CCH habitat quality. Lichens comprise up to 60-86% of the winter diets of Yukon woodland caribou herds, while moss makes up only 1-8%, as estimated from the microhistological analysis of fecal pellets (Farnell and Gardner, 2002). Relative to other Alaskan and Yukon caribou, the CCH appear to have a winter diet that is unusually and low in lichen (31%) and high in moss (51%). Overflight landcover assessments and collections from a limited number of plots suggest that lichen cover with the range is sparse and dominated by nutrient-poor Stereocaulon species (Clarke and Waterreus, 2012), an indicator of poor winter habitat for reindeer (Swanson and Barker, 1992). More data on lichen and moss cover with the CCH range are needed to corroborate these results. In addition to cover, lichen biomass is an important measurement of caribou forage quality. If overgrazing occurs, lichen biomass may not be correlated with lichen cover, and caribou have shown preference for regions with low lichen cover, but high lichen biomass (Collins et al., 2010). Lichen biomass is commonly estimated from mean lichen mat thickness (Lieb, 1994; Arseneault et al., 1997; Moen et al. 2007; Collins et al., 2010). Therefore, measuring lichen thickness and cover in the CCH range may capture key details for assessing winter habitat.

Summer forage is also an important component of caribou habitat. Low recruitment in caribou populations in the Southern Alaska Peninsula is thought to be due to a combination of low winter lichen availability and poor summer range quality (Post and Klein, 1999). Caribou summer diet is typically composed of grasses, sedges, forbs, and willows (Boertje, 1984). Manipulation experiments within the CCH range suggest that climate change may affect caribou summer forage quality and abundance (Lenart et al., 2002). In this study, we aim to establish baseline monitoring of vegetation within the CCH range. Secondly, we estimate lichen cover and biomass across the CCH range to assess habitat quality relative to those of other caribou, particularly the neighboring Kluane, Aishihik, and Nelchina herds. In this report, we describe results from first season of data collection, present preliminary findings, and offer recommendations for future study years.

# Methods

# Dataset Processing Description

Judy et al. did vegetation point intercept on plots in the Chisana caribou range, recording vegetation species contacted every half meter per line. This resulted in 40 intercepts per line X 3 lines = 120 intercepts per plot. They recorded intercepts at varying depths of vegetation from the canopy down to the soil surface. I added up all the intercepts on the line by species and divided by the total number of intercepts to arrive at a proportion of total hits by species. Hopefully this is as intended.

# Study Area

We focus on the core range of the CCH within WRST National Park and Preserve boundaries. This area forms the basin between the Wrangell, St. Elias, and Nutzotin Mountains, containing the Chisana and White Rivers and the historic town of Chisana. Study area limits were defined to include the bulk of CCH radio collar signals recorded between 1988 and 2015 (Fig. 1; J. Putera, unpublished data, 2015). The resulting area is 2795 km^2^ (1079 miles^2^ ) and contains moderate to high elevations, from 1000 - 2500 m (3281–8202 ft).

## Plots

33 plots total

```{r, echo=FALSE,tab.cap="Table 1. Baseline vegetation monitoring plots in the range of the Chisana caribou herd. Spatial coordinates are WGS 1984."}

# Get the plots into a frame
sql = "SELECT 
Plots.Plot
,Ecotypes.Ecotype
, Plots.Elev_m as [Elevation (m)]
, Plots.Lat as Latitude
, Plots.Lon
As Longitude
FROM Plots INNER JOIN
 Ecotypes ON Plots.EcotypeID = Ecotypes.EcotypeID
ORDER BY Plots.Plot, Ecotypes.Ecotype"
Plots = dbGetQuery(connection,sql)
knitr::kable(Plots)
```

## Number of plots by ecotype

Why only one plot in Forest?

```{r, echo=FALSE, tab.cap="Table 2. 'Table 2. Number of plots by ecotype, with mean elevation.'."}
sql="SELECT Ecotypes.Ecotype
, COUNT(*) AS n
, AVG(Plots.Elev_m) AS [Mean elevation (m)]
FROM Plots INNER JOIN
 Ecotypes ON Plots.EcotypeID = Ecotypes.EcotypeID
GROUP BY Ecotypes.Ecotype
ORDER BY n DESC"
dbGetQuery(connection,sql)

sqldf("SELECT Ecotypes.Ecotype
, COUNT(*) AS n
, AVG(Plots.Elev_m) AS [Mean elevation (m)]
FROM Plots INNER JOIN
 Ecotypes ON Plots.EcotypeID = Ecotypes.EcotypeID
GROUP BY Ecotypes.Ecotype
ORDER BY n DESC")

```

## Mean plot elevation by ecotype

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Mean plot elevation by ecotype."}
ggplot(Plots) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Ecotype,y=`Elevation (m)`)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  # Make X axis labels vertical
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5)) +
  ggtitle('Mean plot elevation (m) by ecotype')


```

## Map

A map of the plots is shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Map the units in Leaflet
leaflet() %>%
  
  # Set the view and zoom levels
  setView(lng = mean(Plots$Lon), lat = mean(Plots$Lat), zoom = 9) %>%
  
  # Add WMS tiles
  addWMSTiles('https://basemap.nationalmap.gov:443/arcgis/services/USGSTopo/MapServer/WmsServer',layers = "0",options = WMSTileOptions(format = "image/png"))  %>%

  # Add the points
  addCircleMarkers(lng = Plots$Lon, lat = Plots$Lat, popup = Plots$Plot) %>%
 
  # Label the units 
  addLabelOnlyMarkers(~Lon,~Lat, label = ~Plot, data = Plots,  labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = TRUE))

```

# Vegetation Cover

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Figure 1. Percent cover by taxa in the range of the Chisana caribou herd."}

# Get the dataset from the database
dbGetQuery(connection,"SELECT 
ScientificName as Taxa
--, TopCanopyIntercepts
--, TotalHitsPossible
, PctCover_TopCanopy as [Foliar % cover]
--, GrowthHabitSub, SpeciesCode
FROM            Summary_VegData_PercentCover
WHERE NOT GrowthHabitSub IN ('Lichen Crust','Moss')
ORDER BY PctCover_TopCanopy DESC")


# Plot percent cover by growth habit
# ggplot(CoverData) +
#   geom_col(aes(x=1,y=`Foliar % cover`,fill=ScientificName),position='fill') +
#   theme_minimal() +
#   # Make X axis labels vertical
#   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Stats for the previous figure
# knitr::kable(sqldf("select GrowthHabitSub
#   , avg(PercentCover) as Mean
#   , min(PercentCover) as Min
#   , max(PercentCover) as Max
#   , stdev(PercentCover) as SD
#   , count(PercentCover) as n
#   FROM CoverData group by GrowthHabitSub order by Mean DESC"),caption='Table 1. Mean percent cover by plant growth habit over the Chisana caribou herd range ')

```

# Vegetation Cover By Ecotype

Next, I generated the same chart but parsed the results by ecotype (Jorgenson). Lichen crust is pronounced in the Alpine Meadow ecotype. It would be neat to see if the GPS collar data shows the caribou loitering in this ecotype.

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Figure 2. Percent cover by plant growth habit and Jorgenson ecotype."}
# Plot the percent cover by ecotype
ggplot(CoverData) +
  geom_col(aes(x=Ecotype,y=PercentCover,fill=GrowthHabitSub),position='fill') +
  theme_minimal() +
  # Make X axis labels vertical
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Stats for the previous figure
# knitr::kable(sqldf("select Ecotype,GrowthHabitSub
#   , avg(PercentCover) as Mean
#   , min(PercentCover) as Min
#   , max(PercentCover) as Max
#   , stdev(PercentCover) as SD
#   , count(PercentCover) as n
#   FROM CoverData 
#   group by EcoType, GrowthHabitSub 
#   order by EcoType,Mean DESC"),caption='Table 2. Mean ercent cover by plant growth habit and Jorgenson ecotype.')

```

# Lichen Height

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Get the lichen height data
LichenHeightData = dbGetQuery(connection,"SELECT Ecotype, LichenHeight FROM Dataset_VegData ORDER BY Ecotype")
ggplot(LichenHeightData) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Ecotype,y=LichenHeight)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5)) 

#LichenHeightByEcotype = dbGetQuery(connection,"SELECT        Ecotype, Min, Max, Mean, SD, n FROM Summary_VegData_LichenHeightByEcotype ORDER BY Mean DESC")
# ggplot(LichenHeightByEcotype) +
#   geom_col(aes(x=Ecotype,y=Mean)) +
#   geom_errorbar(aes(x=Ecotype,ymin=Mean-SD,ymax=Mean+SD)) +
#   #geom_boxplot(aes(x=Ecotype,y=Mean))
#   theme_minimal() +
#   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5)) 
# 
# LichenHeightByEcotype

```

# Conclusion

I've only scratched the surface here but I think there are a great many things we can do with these data. Once I'm done with preliminary data analysis and dealing with data quality issues I'll post files to NPS Data Store.
