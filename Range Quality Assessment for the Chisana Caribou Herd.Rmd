# Introduction

[copied from LM's preliminary report]

The Chisana Caribou Herd (CCH) is a small herd of woodland caribou located in northeastern Wrangell St. Elias (WRST) National Park and Preserve in Alaska and the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge in the Yukon. During the early 1990s, many caribou herds in interior Alaska experienced population declines of varying severity (Valkenburg et al., 1996). From 1989 to 2001, the CCH population dropped from an estimated 1800 to 400 individuals (R. Farnell, unpublished data). The CCH became listed as a “Specially Protected” population in 2002 under the Yukon’s Federal Species at Risk Act. After the implementation of a captive rearing program and the development of an international, multiagency management plan, the CCH population is now stable and open to subsistence hunting. However, the current population is significantly below pre-decline levels. Several factors most likely contributed to the CCH population decline including predation, low recruitment, and poor habitat.

Lichens may be the greatest feature limiting CCH habitat quality. Lichens comprise up to 60-86% of the winter diets of Yukon woodland caribou herds, while moss makes up only 1-8%, as estimated from the microhistological analysis of fecal pellets (Farnell and Gardner, 2002). Relative to other Alaskan and Yukon caribou, the CCH appear to have a winter diet that is unusually and low in lichen (31%) and high in moss (51%). Overflight landcover assessments and collections from a limited number of plots suggest that lichen cover with the range is sparse and dominated by nutrient-poor Stereocaulon species (Clarke and Waterreus, 2012), an indicator of poor winter habitat for reindeer (Swanson and Barker, 1992). More data on lichen and moss cover with the CCH range are needed to corroborate these results. In addition to cover, lichen biomass is an important measurement of caribou forage quality. If overgrazing occurs, lichen biomass may not be correlated with lichen cover, and caribou have shown preference for regions with low lichen cover, but high lichen biomass (Collins et al., 2010). Lichen biomass is commonly estimated from mean lichen mat thickness (Lieb, 1994; Arseneault et al., 1997; Moen et al. 2007; Collins et al., 2010). Therefore, measuring lichen thickness and cover in the CCH range may capture key details for assessing winter habitat.

Summer forage is also an important component of caribou habitat. Low recruitment in caribou populations in the Southern Alaska Peninsula is thought to be due to a combination of low winter lichen availability and poor summer range quality (Post and Klein, 1999). Caribou summer diet is typically composed of grasses, sedges, forbs, and willows (Boertje, 1984). Manipulation experiments within the CCH range suggest that climate change may affect caribou summer forage quality and abundance (Lenart et al., 2002). In this study, we aim to establish baseline monitoring of vegetation within the CCH range. Secondly, we estimate lichen cover and biomass across the CCH range to assess habitat quality relative to those of other caribou, particularly the neighboring Kluane, Aishihik, and Nelchina herds. In this report, we describe results from first season of data collection, present preliminary findings, and offer recommendations for future study years.

# Methods

## Study Area

We focus on the core range of the CCH within WRST National Park and Preserve boundaries. This area forms the basin between the Wrangell, St. Elias, and Nutzotin Mountains, containing the Chisana and White Rivers and the historic town of Chisana. Study area limits were defined to include the bulk of CCH radio collar signals recorded between 1988 and 2015 (Fig. 1; J. Putera, unpublished data, 2015). The resulting area is 2795 km^2^ (1079 miles^2^ ) and contains moderate to high elevations, from 1000 - 2500 m (3281–8202 ft).

We chose to proportionally allocate sampling sites to six major ecotypes within the study area (Table 1). Major ecotypes were developed by consolidating the detailed ecotypes mapped in WRST by Jorgenson et al. (2008) using satellite imagery. We grouped Jorgenson et al. ecotypes into groups based on the similarity of their definitions and geographic size (Table 1; Fig. 2). We included all ecotypes except for glaciated barrens. In our study region, the three most common ecotypes by percent cover are Alpine Dwarf Shrub/Barrens (28.1%), Subalpine Wood/Shrub (28.1%), and Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Shrub (24.3%). Riverine, Alpine Meadow, and Forest ecotypes make up the remaining 19.4% of the region.

We generated 56 random points for site locations within the Chisana caribou herd range (Appendix A). We included a 3000 m buffer between sites to ensure an even geographic distribution throughout the study area. Points that fell within rivers were moved to the nearest accessible riverine ecotype and points on excessively steep terrain were eliminated. We re-assigned ecotypes after field data collection using the formal WSRT ecotype classification key (summarized in Table 1; Jorgenson et al., 2008). We visited 23 sites in July, 2015 and 10 sites in July, 2016. Sites were accessed by helicopter or foot using a Trimble or Garmin GPS for navigation (Fig. 3). Permanent plots were established at all sites except those falling with a proposed Archeological District around Wiki Peak. Permanent plots were marked with a 60 cm-long rebar located at plot centers. At each site, we described physical landscape characteristics such as slope position, drainage, and geomorphic disturbance.

Figure 1. Defining the core range of the Chisana caribou herd in northeastern WRST Park and Preserve. Points are radio collar signals recorded from 1988 to 2015 during summer or winter seasons. The core range (yellow border) was selected to include the majority of radio signals within WRST (green border).

Why only one plot in Forest? Merkhofer: "We found that Forest ecotypes made for difficult helicopter landing access and subsequently sampled only one site from this ecotype. Future sampling should be targeted to these under-sampled ecotypes."

## Vegetation Cover

We recorded vegetation along three 20 m-long transects oriented at 0, 120, and 240° from the plot center (Figure 4). Each transect was photographed and measured for slope. Transects were systematically sampled at 50 cm intervals using the line-point intercept method for 40 observations per transect. At each point, we recorded all intercepted overstory and understory taxa, soil surface cover, and lichen height. We identified taxa to the species or genus-level. We considered forage lichen as the genera Cladina, Cladonia (excluding species with cup-shaped podetia), Cetraria (excluding C. richardsonii), and Stereocaulon, following Collins et al. (2011). We estimated the percent cover of major life forms across the entire study area as the average of ecotype means weighted by ecotype area. Percent cover was calculated for each plot as total number of plant intercepts by species divided by 120 (3 transects X 40 sampling points).

**[I didn't do the below because I need help with it]**

**Following the methods recommended by Elzinga et al. (1998), we sequentially sampled percent cover values to test for a stable estimate of the overall population mean and standard deviation. We additionally used two-tailed significance tests to determine the necessary sample size for estimating percent cover for a single population and for detecting differences in percent cover between two time periods.**

## Lichen Thickness and Estimated Biomass

Lichen height was measured using a 3 mm-wide metal skewer inserted into the base of the lichen mat (Arseneault et al., 1997; Moen et al. 2007; Collins et al., 2010) at each of the 40 vegetation intercept points per transect. We calculated the mean lichen height of each plot as the average of all heights, including zero heights where no lichen was present. We estimated lichen biomass (kg/ha) for each plot from mean lichen height using the Moen et al. (2007) regression based on four forage lichen species:

$B=1135.6T$,

where T is mean lichen mat thickness (cm).

## Litter Depth and Composition

Litter depth was sampled from 10 cm-diameter soil plugs removed at the terminus of each transect. Our litter depth measurements include the height of any living mat-forming vegetation, such as moss.

# NOTES: It appears that Merkhofer took Jorgenson et al. 2008's landcover classification and merged various subecotypes together into larger ecotypes. The Major ecotype column in Table 1, below, is Merkhofer's ecotype derived from the 'Included detailed ecotypes' which come from Jorgenson.

# Merkhofer documented her GIS work well in \\inpyugamsstor00\Primary Datapool\I&M\CAKN\CAKN2\Monitoring\Caribou\WRST\Projects\Chisana Caribou Habitat Assessment\Data\Habitat\Chisana Vegetation Sampling\)

# Merkhofer's steps as I can reproduce them:

# 1. She loaded Jorgenson's landcover into a geodatabase: J:\Monitoring\Caribou\WRST\Projects\Chisana Caribou Habitat Assessment\Data\Habitat\GIS\ChisanaCaribouHabitat.gdb as WRSTEcotypes2008Chisana

# 2. She combined various cover classes into larger major ecotypes and added a SamplingGroup column (example SWB corresponding to Subalpine Wood/Shrub)

# 3. These merged major ecotypes became a feature class Ecotypes_in_one_shapefile. This layer is what is shown in Figure 2 of the Merkhofer, 2015 report

# 4. She then chose potential veg plot locations in the major ecotypes for locating sampling plots (Chisana_Veg_Sampling_Points in the geodatabase, APPENDIX A. RANDOM SITE LOCATIONS AND STUDY STATUS in her report)


```

## Fecal Pellet Analysis

We collected fecal pellets from the range of the Chisana caribou herd in order to quantify what plants the Chisana caribou were feeding on. Collected fecal pellets were analyzed for taxa by XXX lab

## Statistical Software

R (R Core Team, 2024) and R Studio software (Posit team, 2024) was used for all analyses.

# Caribou Ecotype Preference

I performed a spatial join of the GPS collar data over the major ecotypes to see where caribou were spending their time. I used the 'Join Attributes by Location' tool in QGIS to add the ecotype to each GPS fix. I then summarized the number of pings by ecotype.

### Foliar cover

\*Unweighted by ecotype area.

Question: Merkhofer states "We estimated the percent cover of major life forms across the entire study area as the average of ecotype means weighted by ecotype area." She did not give a formula. I'm uncertain how to weight means. The tables below give gover as the number of point intercept hits divided by the total number of available tries, unweighted by ecotype area.]

Results:

-   Overall foliar plant cover in the vegetation plots we sampled was dominated by dwarf birch, sedges, *Dryas* and willow, species emblematic of alpine tundra.

```{r, echo=FALSE,tab.cap=paste("Table ",TableCounter,". Percent foliar cover by taxa in the range of the Chisana caribou herd having cover greater than 1%.",sep="")}

WHERE GrowthHabitSub NOT IN ('Moss','Lichen Crust','Abiotic')
And PctCover_TopCanopy > 1
AND PctCover_TopCanopy > 0
ORDER BY PctCover_TopCanopy DESC"),digits=0)
```

<!-- ### Mid-story Cover -->

<!-- -   Mid-story percent cover values are very low because of diminishing likelihood of a hit in Lower2 and exponentially diminishing likelihood of a hit on Lower3. We can't just sum Lower1-3 and divide by the number of hit opportunities. LM ignored Lower1-3, probably for this reason? Or should we just use Lower1? -->

## Lichen Layer Thickness and Biomass

NOTES on lichen biomass: I'm using LM's conversion of lichen height to biomas "We estimated lichen biomass for each plot from mean lichen height using the Moen et al. (2007) regression based on four forage lichen species as B=1135.6T where T is mean lichen mat thickness (cm) and B is mean lichen mat biomass (kg/ha). ,1135.6 \* AVG(IFNULL(v.LichenHeight,0)) as [Estimated lichen biomass (kg/ha)" without really knowing much about that methodology.

Also Moen et al. considered 4 leafy lichens. LM and JP did not distinguish any species of lichens in their lichen height measument at each point intercept ("We calculated the mean lichen height of each plot as the average of all heights, including zero heights where no lichen was present").

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Discussion

## Vegetation Cover

Foliar cover is dominated by Betula glandulosa 17%, Unknown sedge, 12% Dryas octopetala, 9% and Salix spp. at 8%. Basal cover is overwhelmingly dominated by Moss, 42% Unknown sedges 6%, Cladonia sp. 5% Stereocaulon sp. 4% Cetraria sp. 3% Empetrum nigrum 3% Peltigera sp. 2%

### Lichen Layer Thickness and Biomass

Lichen layer thickness ranged from 0.83cm in riverine habitats to 1.7cm in the Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Shrub ecotype, excluding the Forest ecotype where we only had one sample with a mean thickness of 2.77 cm.

[It's interesting that caribou seem to avoid Forest ecotype even though it has the most lichen. Possibly deep snow, insects, or predation?]

### Litter Depth and Composition

### Caribou Ecotype Preference

Caribou seem to use the Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Shrub ecotype year round and this ecotype showed the thickest lichen layer of all ecotypes except the Forest ecotype.

Caribou show distinct seasonal use of the Alpine Dwarf Shrub/Barrens ecotype, migrating out in the winter and in during the summer. [Insect relief?]
