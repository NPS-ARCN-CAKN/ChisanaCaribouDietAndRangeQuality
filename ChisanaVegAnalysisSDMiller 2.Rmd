# Introduction

            The Chisana Caribou Herd (CCH) is a small herd of woodland caribou located in northeastern Wrangell St. Elias (WRST) National Park and Preserve in Alaska and the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge in the Yukon. During the early 1990s, many caribou herds in interior Alaska experienced population declines of varying severity (Valkenburg et al., 1996). From 1989 to 2001, the CCH population dropped from an estimated 1800 to 400 individuals (R. Farnell, unpublished data). The CCH became listed as a “Specially Protected” population in 2002 under the Yukon’s Federal Species at Risk Act. After the implementation of a captive rearing program and the development of an international, multiagency management plan, the CCH population is now stable and open to subsistence hunting. However, the current population is significantly below pre-decline levels. Several factors most likely contributed to the CCH population decline including predation, low recruitment, and poor habitat.

Lichens may be the greatest feature limiting CCH habitat quality. Lichens comprise up to 60-86% of the winter diets of Yukon woodland caribou herds, while moss makes up only 1-8%, as estimated from the microhistological analysis of fecal pellets (Farnell and Gardner, 2002). Relative to other Alaskan and Yukon caribou, the CCH appear to have a winter diet that is unusually and low in lichen (31%) and high in moss (51%). Overflight landcover assessments and collections from a limited number of plots suggest that lichen cover with the range is sparse and dominated by nutrient-poor *Stereocaulon* species(Clarke and Waterreus, 2012), an indicator of poor winter habitat for reindeer (Swanson and Barker, 1992). More data on lichen and moss cover with the CCH range are needed to corroborate these results. In addition to cover, lichen biomass is an important measurement of caribou forage quality. If overgrazing occurs, lichen biomass may not be correlated with lichen cover, and caribou have shown preference for regions with low lichen cover, but high lichen biomass (Collins et al., 2010). Lichen biomass is commonly estimated from mean lichen mat thickness (Lieb, 1994; Arseneault et al., 1997; Moen et al. 2007; Collins et al., 2010). Therefore, measuring lichen thickness and cover in the CCH range may capture key details for assessing winter habitat.

Summer forage is also an important component of caribou habitat. Low recruitment in caribou populations in the Southern Alaska Peninsula is thought to be due to a combination of low winter lichen availability and poor summer range quality (Post and Klein, 1999). Caribou summer diet is typically composed of grasses, sedges, forbs, and willows (Boertje, 1984).  Manipulation experiments within the CCH range suggest that climate change may affect caribou summer forage quality and abundance (Lenart et al., 2002). In this study, we aim to establish baseline monitoring of vegetation within the CCH range. Secondly, we estimate lichen cover and biomass across the CCH range to assess habitat quality relative to those of other caribou, particularly the neighboring Kluane, Aishihik, and Nelchina herds. In this report, we describe results from first season of data collection, present preliminary findings, and offer recommendations for future study years.

# Materials and Methods

## Study Area

We focus on the core range of the CCH within WRST National Park and Preserve boundaries. This area forms the basin between the Wrangell, St. Elias, and Nutzotin Mountains, containing the Chisana and White Rivers and the historic town of Chisana. Study area limits were defined to include the bulk of CCH radio collar signals recorded between 1988 and 2015 (Fig. 1; J. Putera, unpublished data, 2015). The resulting area is 2795 km^2^ (1079 miles^2^ ) and contains moderate to high elevations, from 1000 - 2500 m (3281–8202 ft).

## Vegetation sampling

We chose to proportionally allocate sampling sites to six major ecotypes within the study area (Table 1). Major ecotypes were developed by consolidating the detailed ecotypes mapped in WRST by Jorgenson et al. (2008) using satellite imagery. We grouped Jorgenson et al. ecotypes into groups based on the similarity of their definitions and geographic size (Table 1; Fig. 2). We included all ecotypes except for glaciated barrens. In our study region, the three most common ecotypes by percent cover are Alpine Dwarf Shrub/Barrens (28.1%), Subalpine Wood/Shrub (28.1%), and Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Shrub (24.3%). Riverine, Alpine Meadow, and Forest ecotypes make up the remaining 19.4% of the region.

### Question: Is each plot in an ecotype? Do we need Jorgensen's data layer, or can we re-use her file

*Notes:* Cover values were calculated using a landcover map based on satellite imagery within the study area (Fig. 1). \*Landcover ecotypes defined and mapped in Jorgenson et al. (2008).

## Figure 1. Defining the core range of the Chisana caribou herd in northeastern WRST Park and Preserve. Points are radio collar signals recorded from 1988 to 2015 during summer or winter seasons. The core range (yellow border) was selected to include the majority of radio signals within WRST (green border).

## Figure 2. Major ecotypes within the Chisana caribou range in northeastern WRST Park and Preserve (Table 1). Map based on ecotype landcover developed by Jorgenson et al. (2008).

We generated 56 random points for site locations using Esri ArcGIS® software. We included a 3000 m buffer between sites to ensure an even geographic distribution throughout the study area (geographic locations of sites are listed in Appendix A). Points that fell within rivers were moved to the nearest accessible riverine ecotype and points on excessively steep terrain were eliminated. We re-assigned ecotypes after field data collection using the formal WSRT ecotype classification key (summarized in Table 1; Jorgenson et al., 2008).

We visited a total of 23 sites during July, 2015. Sites were accessed by helicopter or foot using a Trimble or Garmin GPS for navigation (Fig. 3). Permanent plots were established at all sites except those falling with a proposed Archeological District around Wiki Peak. Permanent plots were marked with a 60 cm-long rebar located at plot centers. At each site, we described physical landscape characteristics such as slope position, drainage, and geomorphic disturbance. We recorded vegetation along three 20 m-long transects oriented at 0, 120, and 240° from the plot center. Each transect was photographed and measured for slope. Transects were systematically sampled at 50 cm intervals using the line-point intercept method. At each point, we recorded all intercepted over- and understory taxa, soil surface cover, and lichen height. Lichen height was measured using a 3 mm-wide metal skewer inserted into the base of the lichen mat (Arseneault et al., 1997; Moen et al. 2007; Collins et al., 2010). We calculated the mean lichen height of each plot as the average of all heights, including zero heights where no lichen was present. Litter depth was sampled from 10 cm-diameter soil plugs removed at the terminus of each transect. Our litter depth measurements include the height of any living mat-forming vegetation, such as moss (See Appendix B for detailed field measurement protocol).

            We identified taxa to the species or genus-level. We considered forage lichen as the genera *Cladina, Cladonia* (excluding species with cup-shaped podetia)*, Cetraria* (excluding *C. richardsonii*)*,* and *Stereocaulon,* following Collins et al. (2011). We estimated the percent cover of major life forms across the entire study area as the average of ecotype means weighted by ecotype area.

## Lichen biomass

We estimated lichen biomass for each plot from mean lichen height using the Moen et al. (2007) regression based on four forage lichen species:

where *T* is mean lichen mat thickness (cm) and *B* is mean lichen mat biomass (kg/ha).

## Statistical analyses

R Studio software (RStudio Team, 2015) was used for all analyses. Following the methods recommended by Elzinga et al. (1998), we sequentially sampled percent cover values to test for a stable estimate of the overall population mean and standard deviation. We additionally used two-tailed significance tests to determine the necessary sample size for estimating percent cover for a single population and for detecting differences in percent cover between two time periods.

## Figure 3. Vegetation sampling sites in the Chisana caribou herd range. Sites visited in 2015 (green) and proposed for future study years (red) are labeled with site IDs. See Appendix A for the geographic locations of all sites.

The veg sampling map in figure 3, page 7 of the Merkhover report is reproduced below.

# Results

## Site sample size

We need to sample at least seven more sites in order to improve our confidence in CCH range quality assessments relative to those of other caribou herds.  Our preliminary results show that a cumulative sample size of 30 sites is needed in order to be 80% confident that percent cover estimates for the CHH range are within 10% of the true frequencies.  We recommend setting this as a target sample size for 2016, with a proportional allocation between ecotypes (Table 2).

A larger sample size is needed for establishing baseline vegetation monitoring within the CCH range. From our current results, we estimate that a cumulative total of 46 sites need to be sampled in order to be 80% confident of detecting at least a 20% change in percent cover overtime (with a false-change error rate of 20%). We therefore recommend using this sample size as a target for the first monitoring cycle before re-visiting sites (Table 2).

Due to a combination of weather constraints and ecotype reassessments, the current dataset of 23 sites over-represents the Subalpine Wood/Shrub ecotype and under-represents Alpine Dwarf Shrub/Barrens and Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Willow Shrub ecotypes. We found that Forest ecotypes made for difficult helicopter landing access and subsequently sampled only one site from this ecotype. Future sampling should be targeted to these under-sampled ecotypes.

*Notes:* Proposed target sample sizes based on the 2015 field season.Sample sizes for 2016 and 1^st^ cycle are the estimated minimum number of additional sites needed to describe the current population, and detect change between monitoring cycles, respectively. Target *N* is the cumulative total number of sites for one monitoring cycle.

## Vegetation cover

Across plots, the taxa with the highest mean percent cover were sedges, closely followed by *Betula glandulosa* (dwarf birch) and *Salix* (willows; Table 3). The most common lichen genera by cover were *Cladina* (3.9%), *Cetraria* (3.6%), and *Stereocaulon* (2.8%). Mean lichen cover across plots ranged from 0 to 45%.

In all ecotypes except for Alpine Dwarf-Shrub/Barrens, moss cover was higher than lichen cover (Fig. 4). The ecotypes with the most lichen cover were Alpine-Dwarf Shrub/Barrens (29%) and Forest (28%), while Alpine Sedge Dwarf-Willow Meadows (9%) and Riverine (5%; Fig. 5) had the least. Across the whole study area, soil surface cover was largely moss (40 ± 6.3%) with fewer lichens (16.7 ± 4.2 %, and 11.2 ± 3.1% for forage lichens; Table 4).

## Lichen mat thickness

Lichen mats in the CCH range were up to 7.5 cm thick and had mean plot thicknesses between from 0 to 0.7 cm (Appendix D). Alpine Dwarf Shrub/Barrens had the largest mean lichen height (0.29 cm; Fig. 5). The lowest mean lichen heights were found in Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Willow Shrub (0.05 cm) and Riverine (0.09 cm) ecotypes. The mean lichen thickness weighted over the entire study area was 0.21 ± 0.06 cm and the biomass estimated from this value is 238 ± 68 kg/ha.

I think ChisanaVegResults is the mean lichen height by veg classification (Jorgensen) for each plot.

# Discussion

## Winter range quality

Previous studies suggested that the few lichen-rich areas present in the CCH range were dominated by *Stereocaulon* lichen, a genus with low nutritional value (Clarke and Waterreus, 2012). However, our results indicate a potentially more favorable habitat.  We found that the relatively nutrient-rich *Cladina* and *Cetraria* lichens were more common in the CCH range than *Stereocaulon*, although *Stereocaulon* was also abundant (Table 3). Further, the ecotype with the most lichen by cover and biomass, Alpine Dwarf-Shrub/Barrens, also was one of the most common ecotypes in the study area (Table 1). Alpine Meadows and Forest were also relatively lichen-rich ecotypes and most likely are important caribou habitats. These ecotypes are similar to those found to have the most lichen within the Kluane herd range (Oosenbrug, 1976; Oosenbrug and Theberge, 1980).

In comparison to other caribou herds in Alaska and the Yukon, the CCH range has similar cover of moss and trees, but relatively higher cover of shrubs, forbs, and graminoids (Table 4). Like the CCH, the Kluane herd has a range mostly composed of shrubs and graminoids (Oosenbrug, 1976). The Southern Alaska Peninsula herd (SAPCH) range has moss and graminoid cover that are similar to the Klaune herd range, but with lower shrub cover (Post & Klein, 1999).Conversely, the Little Rancheria herd range has much lower graminoid cover (0.5%, compared to 40% for the CCH; Florkiewicz et al., 2004), but similar moss cover as the CCH range. Additionally, the Western Artic Herd ranges in an area with similar moss and tree cover as the CCH, but lower graminoid and shrub cover (Joly et al., 2010). Overall, the differing vegetation cover values of each herd indicate wide habitat variability.

*Notes:* Values are means; Abbreviations: CR: Caribou River group; LRH, Little Rancheria Herd; SAPCH; Southern Alaska Peninsula Caribou Herd; WAH, Western Arctic Herd. 

In terms of lichen cover, the CCH range has cover values that are within the range reported for most other woodland and barren-ground caribou herds: 13-24% for all lichens and 8-11% for forage lichens (Table 5). The Kluane herd and SAPCH were exceptions to this pattern. Both herds have very scarce lichen cover, and the SAPCH has the lowest lichen cover and lichen biomass of any caribou range in Alaska (Post and Klein, 1999). Both herds appear to favor sedges and other graminoids in the winter (Oosenbrug, 1976), and by late winter graminoids make up 30% of the SAPCH diet (Post and Klein, 1999). However, graminoids appear to make up only a small part of the CCH winter diet (3.4 %), compared to moss (51%) and lichens (30.9 %; Farnell and Gardner, 2002). 

Although the CCH range has more lichen cover than the Kluane herd and the SAPCH, several factors suggest that areas of concentrated lichen are scare. We observed very few dense lichen mats in our study area. For example, none of our study sites had lichen cover values approaching 58%, the average value measured in winter feeding sites of the Aishinik herd (Fischer, 2002). Moreover, the CCH range mean lichen biomass of 238 kg/ha is very low compared to those of other Alaskan and Yukon caribou ranges, which can be up to 3799 kg/ha (Table 5; Joly et al. 2010). The CCH range lichen biomass is most similar to that of the Nelchina herd’s historic winter range (224 kg/ha; Collins et al., 2011). Collins et al. suggest that the Nelchina herd’s historic range has lower lichen biomass, but slightly more lichen cover than the herd’s current range. They conclude that this difference is due to caribou over-grazing that reduced lichen mats to fragments with little biomass. The low biomass of lichen in the CCH range may be an indication of limited lichen availability, although we observed evidence of grazed or trampled lichen only at one of the 23 sites. Lower lichen biomass across the CCH range most likely contributes to the unusually low percentage of lichen in CCH diets.

## Summer range quality

The CHH range has relatively abundant graminoids and shrubs compared to those of other Yukon and Alaskan caribou, suggesting a favorable summer habitat. Sedges and willows had the highest mean cover across plots (27.4%, and 21.9%, respectively; Table 3). Further, nearly a fourth of the CCH range is the Alpine Sedge-Dwarf Shrub ecotype, similar to the birch-sedge meadows and sedge meadow communities that are preferred summer feeding sites for other Yukon caribou (Oosenbrug and Theberge, 1980).

# Conclusions

1.      We need to sample seven more sites in order to be confident in our in mean percent cover estimates and an additional 16 sites to be able to detect changes in percent cover between repeated measurement years. Future sampling should be targeted to sites in alpine and forest ecotypes. Suggested target sample sizes for each ecotype are given in Table 2.

2.      Our current results suggest that the most abundant lichens within the CCH range are of *Cladina* and *Cetraria* genera that are preferred caribou forage.

3.      Alpine Dwarf Shrub/Barrens, Forest, and Alpine Meadows are the most lichen-rich ecotypes within the CCH range and may therefore be the most important winter habitats.

4.      Moss and lichen cover within the CHH range are very similar to those of most other Alaskan and Yukon caribou herds, but the CCH lichen biomass of 238 ± 68 kg/ha is much lower. In terms of lichen biomass, the CCH range is most similar to the Nelchina herd’s historic range that is reported to have been overgrazed by caribou. However, lichen cover and biomass within the CCH range are higher than those of some Alaskan and Yukon caribou herds that rely on sedges for winter diet.

# Appendix B. Field Measurement Protocol

This protocol is based on the Central Alaska Network 2010 Vegetation Monitoring Program and the Monitoring Manual for Grassland, Shrubland and Savanna Ecosystems by Jeff Herrick et al. (2005). Video guides on these techniques are available online from the[Landscape Toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9a4lLG3dq60gNsnsGgkVgeUMMxyWLyWG).  Datasheets used for this study are located here: T:\\Wildlife\\Chisana Vegetation Sampling\\ChisanaVeg_Data Forms.docx

I.       Plot establishment and photography

1.      If plot is permanent, stake rebar at the nearest possible point to the plot center (see Fig. 1B). Hammer rebar until sturdy, leaving 30 cm above the ground surface. Record GPS coordinates of the rebar if not already located.

2.  Stake measuring tapes one at a time by sighting orientations (0, 120, 240 degrees) from the plot center with a compass. Anchor the end of each tape at the plot center and walk out the transect 21 m from the plot center, ensuring the tape stays as close to the ground as possible. Walk to the same side of the tape to avoid trampling vegetation.

3.  Take three photographs from the plot center looking down each transect making sure that the photo ID card is visible. Using a dry erase pen to fill out each photocard saves time, but does not work well in rain, so we recommend bringing extra rite-in-the-rain paper. Take one additional photograph of a nearby landmark that could be used to help verify the plot location. Record the aspect of this photo.

II.    Site descriptions and transect data

1.      Record start time and Site ID on the Site Description Form.

2.  Fill out the Cover Transect Data Sheet beginning with transect 1. Stand on the right side of the tape so that distance markers can be read right side up. Drop the pin at the first point, 1.5 m from the plot center, so that it falls on the opposite side of the tape within 25 cm of the tape edge. Record intercepts as any plant that touches the pin. Record the first plant intercepted in the “Top layer” column using the correct species code, and any further plant taxa in the “Lower layer” column. If a single species is intercepted more than once, only record the first intercept. If litter intercepted, record this only as a lower layer. Record the basal intercept in the “Soil Surface” column, either as an intercepted plant base, lichen or moss mat, or as soil, rock, bedrock, or embedded litter using the definitions provided. Mat-forming dwarf shrubs like lingonberry are commonly basal hits when present. If lichen is intercepted, measure its height and record it in the appropriate column. Try to measure the height of the lichen in cross section at the point, not at the thickest part of the lichen. If multiple taxa are present, i.e. a lichen-moss mat, record the single taxon that makes up the majority of the intercepted point. Repeat for all points on all transects.

3.  Sample a soil plug at the end of each transect, 22 m from the plot center. Using a trowel, dig into the litter layer and remove a plug \~10 cm in diameter to the depth of the litter layer. This layer comprises of undecomposed organic detritus that usually have been freshly deposited, like dead needles, leaves, twigs, and branches. Measure litter depth as the width of the litter layer to the top of the soil surface, including the height of any living mat-forming lifeform like moss, lichen, or a dwarf shrub. Classify the dominate litter type as moss, moss/lichen, herbaceous, or coniferous. Record “None” if no litter is present.

4.  Measure the slope of the transect using a clinometer.

5.  Finish filling out the Site Description Form using the following definitions to describe the entire circular plot area. For reference, we provide the official definitions of landforms and geologic terms from the USDA, NRCS National soil survey handbook, title 430-VI.

·         Dominant Species: Briefly list the most abundant taxa (by cover) in each of these categories: Tree, Shrubs, Graminoids (grasses, sedges, and rushes), and Forbs.

·         Slope Position: Select the best description of the location of the plot relative to the surrounding topography:

o   Ridgetop - A long, narrow elevation of the land surface, usually sharp crested with steep sides and forming an extended upland between valleys. The term is used in areas of both hill and mountain relief.

o   Saddle - A low point on a ridge or interfluve, generally a divide (pass) between the heads of streams flowing in opposite directions.

o   Hillslope - The steeper part of a hill between its summit and the drainage line, valley flat, or depression floor at the base of the hill. If selected, describe the aspect, max slope, slope length, and choose the appropriate hillslope position:

§  Shoulder: forms the convex, erosional surface near the top of a hillslope.

§  Arm: forms the steepest and generally linear, middle portion of the slope. In profile, arms are commonly bounded by a convex shoulder above and a concave toe below. They may or may not include cliff segments (i.e., free faces). Arms are commonly erosional forms produced by mass movement, colluvial action, and running water.

§  Toe: forms the gently inclined surface at the base of a hillslope. Toeslopes in profile are commonly gentle and linear, and are constructional surfaces forming the lower part of a hill-slope continuum that grades to valley or closed-depression floors.

o   Colluvium - Unconsolidated, unsorted earth material being transported or deposited on side slopes and/or at the base of slopes by mass movement (e.g., direct gravitational action) and by local, unconcentrated runoff.

o   Piedmont - An area, plain, slope, glacier, or other feature at the base of a mountain; e.g., a foothill

o   Terrace - A step-like surface, bordering a valley floor or shoreline, which represents the former position of a flood plain, or lake or sea shore. The term is usually applied to both the relatively flat summit surface (tread), cut or built by stream or wave action, and the steeper descending slope (scarp, riser), graded to a lower base level of erosion.

o   Floodplain - The nearly level plain that borders a stream and is subject to inundation under flood-stage conditions unless protected artificially. It is usually a constructional landform built of sediment deposited during overflow and lateral migration of the streams.

o   Flat plain - A general term referring to any flat, lowland area, large or small, at a low elevation. Specifically, any extensive region of comparatively smooth and level gently undulating land. A plain may be forested or bare of trees and may be formed by deposition or erosion.

·         Slope X-section: Select a category that best characterizes the shape of the slope contained within the plot, when considered in its vertical profile from the ridge to the toe of the slope.

·         Drainage: Choose the category that most closely describes the drainage characteristics of the soil in a site. Steep slopes are well drained due to water running off the inclined surface; whereas the drainage characteristics of gently sloping sites and flat areas are mostly a function of the permeability of the substrate. Permeability ranges from very well-drained on coarse gravels on unfrozen river gravel areas to extremely impeded drainage on permafrost and/or high clay content soils that restrict the flow of water through the soil column.

·         Microrelief type: Select the type of micro-relief evident in plot.

o   Mass movement-erosional: e.g., a gully, slump scar, or debris flow

o   Mass movement-depositional: e.g., a rock slide or a talus pile

o   Tussock: raised earth formations formed by graminoids, especially *Eriophorum* or *Carex* spp.

o   Solifluction: Slow, viscous downslope flow of water-saturated regolith. Rates of flow vary widely.

o   Moss hummock: micro-relief due to moss growth forms.

o   Thermokarst: Karst-like topographic features produced in a permafrost region by local melting of ground ice and subsequent settling of the ground.

·         Maximum micro-relief size: Estimate the maximum magnitude of physical relief

·         Parent rock type: If you know the lithology of the parent material with certainty, indicate it here.

·         Parent material: The source and composition of parent material.

o   Bedrock – A general term for the solid rock that underlies the soil and other unconsolidated material or that is exposed at the surface.

o   Alluvium – Unconsolidated, clastic material subaerially deposited by running water, including gravel, sand, silt, clay, and various mixtures of these.

o   Till – Dominantly unsorted and unstratified drift, generally unconsolidated and deposited directly by a glacier without subsequent reworking by meltwater, and consisting of a heterogeneous mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, stones, and boulders; rock fragments of various lithologies are imbedded within a finer matrix that can range from clay to sandy loam.

o   Colluvium – Unconsolidated, unsorted earth material being transported or deposited on side slopes and/or at the base of slopes by mass movement (e.g., direct gravitational action) and by local, unconcentrated runoff.

o   Loess – Material transported and deposited by wind and consisting predominantly of silt-size particles.

o   Lacustrine - Clastic sediments and chemical precipitates deposited in lakes.

·         Geomorphic disturbance: Indicate potential disturbance regimes for the plot.

o   Fluvial – produced by stream or river action, e.g., flood deposits

o   Mass movement – process resulting from the dislodgment and downslope transport of soil and rock material as a unit under direct gravitational stress. The process includes slow displacements such as creep and solifluction, and rapid movements such as landslides, rock slides, and falls, earthflows, debris flows, and avalanches.

o   Wind scour - powerful and concentrated clearing and digging action of wind

·         Evidence of frost-action: Frost-action is a set of physical processes that result from repeated freezing (expansion) and thawing (contraction) of water within the soil profile. Some examples of such surface expressions include frost wedge polygons; heaving of cobbles and stones from the soil; large cracks in the soil; and sorting of soil materials according to size and constituents, such as stone stripes within fellfields. These processes have the potential to affect the vegetation in numerous ways including disturbance of root systems and exposure of mineral soil for colonization.

·         Evidence of fire: List any evidence that a fire has occurred in the plot area, including charcoal, burnt trees, healed or fresh fire scars, down wood with scorch mars, or charcoal.

·         Evidence of wind: Record any direct physical evidence of wind on the vegetation or substrate; e.g., trees with “flag” appearance, krumholz trees, dune formations, etc.

·         Wind exposure class: Assign one of the following categories based on the apparent exposure of the plot to prevailing wind:

o   1-Sheltered: the plot is sheltered in three directions. Reserve this category for spots that likely receive very little strong wind because of their position on the landscape.

o   2-Protected: the plot is substantially protected from prevailing wind in two directions, e.g., situated in the lee of ridge top.

o   3-Moderate: the plot has some protection from wind in the form of topographic relief, but is generally open and exposed to prevailing wind currents, and protection is only from one direction.

o   4-Exposed: the plot has no shelter from prevailing winds, for example, an open ridge top or an open flat area that is distant from windbreaks.

6\. Record Ecotype class following the ecotype definitions in Jorgenson et al. 2008 and Table 1.

7\. Record any Caribou sign.

## Explanation

In 2015 Judy Putera and Lisa Merkhover started a project analyzing range cover for the Chisana caribou herd in WRST.

Project directory: [J:\Monitoring\Caribou\WRST\Projects\Chisana Caribou Habitat Assessment](J:\Monitoring\Caribou\WRST\Projects\Chisana%20Caribou%20Habitat%20Assessment)

Report: [J:\Monitoring\Caribou\WRST\Projects\Chisana Caribou Habitat Assessment](J:\Monitoring\Caribou\WRST\Projects\Chisana%20Caribou%20Habitat%20Assessment)

LM did her analysis using R in

J:\\Monitoring\\Caribou\\WRST\\Projects\\Chisana Caribou Habitat Assessment\\Data\\Habitat\\Chisana Vegetation Sampling\\Analysis.

The principal R file was Heights.R. Data files are in that directory with .csv file extensions.

LM and JP went back to WRST and collected more data to augment the 2015 dataset. This file is to reproduce her analyses from Heights.r in a reproducible way with the auxiliary information.

# Questions to be answered

-   LM only presented a boxplot of SurfaceHeight (lichen height) and did not analyze any other data. All her plots other than the boxplot show percent cover of Jorgenson's data

Figure X. Mean lichen mat thickness by Ecotype (Jorgenson et al., 2008). Dotted line shows mean thickness prior to 1990 (source currently unknown), dashed line is thickness in 2002 (determine the source for this)

```{r}

data = readxl::read_xlsx(r'(C:\Work\Projects\Chisana veg habitat databases\2024 Chisana Vegetation Re-analysis Miller\Data\ChisanaVegDatabase_2024.accdb.ChisanaVegQuery.xlsx)')

```

```{r}



# Plot lichen height by distance
# LichenHeight = data %>% 
#   select(Plot,Line,Distance,LichenHeight) %>% 
#   filter(Plot=='ADD10' & is.na(LichenHeight)==FALSE) %>% 
#   arrange(Line,Distance)
# 
# ggplot(LichenHeight) +
#   geom_point(aes(x=Distance,y=LichenHeight))  +
#   #facet_grid(rows=vars(Line)) +
#   theme_minimal()


```
